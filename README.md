Lab07 - Refactoring arraySearch

As a reminder, refactoring is a software engineering process to change the WAY code accomplishes a performs a task without changing WHAT the task itself ( i.e. change how it does something, but NOT what it does).

Refactor arraySearch to remove redundant code. Start with the arraySearchFinal zip file ( see attached ) and refactor it to remove redundant code. Examples include seqSearch ( 3 implementations ) and BinarySearch ( 2 implementations ). Only focus on the search code at this point ( meaning you do NOT need to refactor sorting code, just the search code ).
Be sure to include proof the your code produces identical results before and after your refactoring efforts.
